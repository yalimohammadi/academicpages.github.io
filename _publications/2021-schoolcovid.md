excerpt: 'The most common approaches to looking at the question of school safety focus on absolute risk.  By contrast, we take the perspective that the situation warrants an approach that evaluates school safety from the perspective of relative risk: i.e., are open schools more or less safe than the surrounding community?
In looking at the problem from the perspective of relative risk, we have found a fascinating result. Under most scenarios, students would be as safe or safer in school as in their community.'

The debate around school closures has focused on the question of whether schools are safe in the midst of the pandemic. Most studies look at this issue from the perspective of absolute risk. We consider the perspective of relative risk: in other words, whether children are safer at school or at home. Our model shows, under a reasonable and robust set of assumptions about testing strategies and compliance with CDC guidance on countermeasures, in-person learning can be safer for children than being at home. Interestingly, the model suggests that this benefit increases with rates of community spread. Our model-based findings are in concordance with a broad range of empirical studies suggesting that students are safe at school.
