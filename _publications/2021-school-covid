excerpt: 'The most common approaches to looking at the question of school safety focus on absolute risk.  By contrast, we take the perspective that the situation warrants an approach that evaluates school safety from the perspective of relative risk: i.e., are open schools more or less safe than the surrounding community?
In looking at the problem from the perspective of relative risk, we have found a fascinating result. Under most scenarios, students would be as safe or safer in school as in their community.'
