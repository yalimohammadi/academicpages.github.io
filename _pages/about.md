Hey! I'm Yeganeh, a third year PhD student in [Operations Research](https://or.stanford.edu/) in Management Science and Engineering at Stanford. I am very fortunate to be advised [Amin Saberi](http://stanford.edu/~saberi/). 

Before coming to Stanford, I received BSc in Computer Engineering with a minor in Mathematics from [Sharif University of Technology](http://www.en.sharif.edu/). There I was lucky to work with [Hamid Zarrabi-Zadeh](http://sharif.edu/~zarrabi/) on maximum bicliques in convex graphs.
